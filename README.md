# Guilherme

I am a technology student with a growing interest in software development. 
I have hands-on experience in programming and have been developing skills in both back-end and front-end areas, 
focusing on building functional, well-organized, and maintainable solutions.

With a solid foundation in programming logic, I’m continuously evolving, aiming to understand not just language 
syntax but also the principles behind good software design. I’m familiar with modern development environments 
and always open to learning new tools and methodologies.

I value consistent learning, responsibility in project execution, and teamwork. 
I’m ready to contribute in environments that appreciate initiative, organization, and continuous growth.
